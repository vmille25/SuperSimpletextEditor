# SuperSimpletextEditor
C# based text editor made with WPF


Steps to implement this app:
  1. Create a WPF project (I used .NET Framework 4.7.2 and Visual Studio 2019)
  2. Create the UI by copying the code in the MainWindow.xaml file
  3. Add a reference to the System.Windows.Forms namespace
  4. Copy the code from MainWindow.xaml.cs and **MAKE SURE to change the inital directory of the file dialog to a folder that is on your system.**
  5. Run the application
  6. Enjoy!
